Do you know Hotjar?

Well, in case you don't I'll tell you.

Hotjar is a wonderful tool, in fact a Javascript Library that record all interaction with some internet site that use it.

"Heatmap" and "Visit Record" are two types of things Hotjar can do. Track everything a user do while visit your site, isn't this amazing?

But...

How about the user [privacy] ?

That's right, nobody is thinking about your privacy.

I'm thinking in mine, and in my family's privacy, that's why I wrote this script who simple add IPTABLES rules in my computer to drop Hotjar's connections from the url's bellow:

* hotjar.com
* vars.hotjar.com
* static.hotjar.com
* script.hotjar.com
* insights.hotjar.com
